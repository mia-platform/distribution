# Cert Manager Resources for kube-green

This add-on adds support for Cert Manager Certificate resource for the kube-green webhook instead of
relying on an autogenerated one.  
To work properly it needs both the Cert Manager and kube-green module.

The add-on will add the local issuer and certificate for the kube-green controller, and will remove the initContainers
that are responsible for autogenerate it.

## What the Add-On Contains
