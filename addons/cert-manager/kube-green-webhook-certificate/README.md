# Cert Manager for kube-green Webhook

This add-on adds support for Cert Manager Certificate resource for the kube-green webhook instead of
relying on an autogenerated one.  
To work properly it needs both the Cert Manager and kube-green module.

## What the Add-On Contains

- **Webhooks:** the certificate and local issuer to generate a valid TLS certificate for the kube-green webook,
	and the appropriate patches to remove the `initContainers` from the deployment and setting the right
	annotation on the webhook resource
