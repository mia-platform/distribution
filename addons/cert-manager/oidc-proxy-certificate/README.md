# Cert Manager for kube-oidc-proxy Certificate

This add-on adds support for Cert Manager Certificate resource for the kube-oidc-proxy endpoint instead of
relying on an autogenerated one.  
To work properly it needs both the Cert Manager and kube-oidc-proxy module.

The add-on will add the local issuer and certificate for the kube-oidc-proxy controller, and will remove the
initContainers that are responsible for autogenerate it.
